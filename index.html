  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I have a couple weeks to myself and a decent amount of web development training under my belt, it was finally time to sit down and start researching map-related web development technologies. This is something I have wanted to do from the very beginning, but I lacked the basic programming and development skills to understand any of the map-specific stuff. It will probably come as no surprise at all that I decided to do a map-based project for my P10 challenge at Dev Bootcamp, which is a comprehensive, independent, open-ended project where we build anything, so long as it is a full-stack project (from SQL to CSS). Essentially, the project is a map of all the Mormon/LDS temples in the world. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what and how many features I will implement, but having a map with custom markers, a SQL database, and some aesthetic user interface would be part of the MVP. I feel extremely fortunate that I happened to enroll at DBC during the holidays, because that means I have two extra weeks for digesting information and looking into geography-related technologies that I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by for so long. I&rsquo;ve spend the last few days learning about Mapbox&rsquo;s API, Mapbox.js, which is extremely comprehensive and well documented. I was able to get my own map set up within a few minutes, and Mapbox also provides a ton of tutorials for how to use their API, which is essentially a giant JavaScript library that includes the already comprehensive Leaflet.js library. It&rsquo;s been really exciting to dive into this new material and see all the cool features it has to offer, and even more exciting that I actually understand it! In the past few days, I&rsquo;ve been able to create the front-end MVP of my project&mdash;a custom map with an LDS-themed color scheme, golden Angel Moroni markers marking each temple, and a sidebar menu. There were a couple steps to this process:</p>

<p>Thankfully, I found an XML file with all the LDS Temple data, so all it took was parsing the XML using the Ruby Nokogiri gem, creating Ruby hashes from the XML data, and converting those hashes to geoJSON objects using the json gem (what <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> already done for you in the tech world??). That&rsquo;s where Mapbox&rsquo;s magic takes over. It handles an array of geoJSON objects and adds a layer on its map with those objects, and - voila! - I had a map with all the temples on it!</p>

<p><img src="/images/MMpreview.png" alt="MormonMapper" /></p>

<p>Now, my next challenge is figuring out what the next steps are for the project. I want to store the temple data in a database, probably PostgreSQL, but I am not entirely sure how to go about this. Do I store the temples as JSON objects within the database itself, or create them from the ActiveRecord objects when the database is queried? Fortunately there are lots of geography-related gems and add-ons in Ruby, including PostGIS and geocoder, so I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have a breakthrough shortly. Still, if I had more time to do this project, using Python/Django would probably be the best route in terms of support for geo-features, but that would be a much larger project, as it would mean learning a new language and framework (perhaps something to do post-DBC while job-hunting? I think so!).</p>

<p> In any event, it&rsquo;s been awesome to delve into all this new material &ndash; and even cooler that it indulges my lifelong interest in geography.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been a little while since I&rsquo;ve posted on here, but of course that&rsquo;s to be expected, since the intensive, on-site portion of DBC started a couple days after my last post. I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe how much I have learned, struggled, and grown through the first phase. Although learning, struggling, and growing could be seen as three sides of some mutant three-sided coin (I guess that would be like a cylinder?), which indeed they are, I&rsquo;ll reflect briefly upon the three of them separately.</p>

<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>I have learned a great deal of new material, but most importantly, I have learned new paradigms and have taken my already existing Ruby knowledge to a level I never knew existed. A few weeks ago ago I would have been proud of a 15-line method that checked whether or not a credit card number was valid. Gone are the days of creating these &lsquo;all-in-ones&rsquo;, what DBC calls <em>God Methods</em>. I have learned the concepts of single responsibility methods and classes, object-oriented design, and reducing dependencies&mdash;within classes, between classes, and even in methods by using the argument hash.</p>

<p>Another significant learning feat was moving in the direction of less primitive terminal apps by impleneting multiple-file apps, SQL databases, ActiveRecord, and the model-view-controller design paradigm (hinting towards the beast that is Ruby on Rails).</p>

<p>Beyond this, my Ruby skills have improved a great deal, as I feel leagues more confident navigating almost any programming problem. The difficult part is no longer &ldquo;how do I do this in Ruby?&rdquo;, but rather, &ldquo;how do I break this problem down into tangible steps?&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Struggling</h3>

<p>I have struggled in two major regards these past few weeks: one, in how to approach programming challenges with many components, such as with the Sudoku solver challenge during the first week of Phase 1; and two, in how to work on a project with people of varying personalities, from timid and quiet to dominant and loud. The idea of fleshing out the problem in pseudocode (or as one of my Phase 1 teachers calls it on the Friday of Sudoku, Sud-<em>o</em>-code) was one I could grasp in the abstract, but when it came down to tackling the problem, I always felt myself gravitating towards just hacking away at the keyboard without giving the problem enough forethought. It was my first experience tackling a challenge of this magnitude, and for the first time I couldn&rsquo;t really get away with my Phase 0 forge-ahead-blindly approach. This refusal to take a step back led to much frustration and ultimately not being able to complete the challenge by the end of the day. Although I did complete it the next day, the big takeaway from that day-long struggle was to make sure you know what you&rsquo;re going to do before you do it. Never explore unfamiliar territory without a map&mdash;or at the very least, a compass!</p>

<p>One more struggle, which combines the two above: group work, especially with unclear expectations and ambiguous leadership. It&rsquo;s not easy, and it&rsquo;s very frustrating. The lack of clarity leads to not being able to delegate tasks, and instead everyone working on the same task, which is incredibly inefficient. As Sherif, one of my teachers, put it, it&rsquo;s like doing an &ldquo;eight legged sock race&rdquo;, which is exactly how it felt during one exercise.</p>

<h3>Growing</h3>

<p>My growing is very much tied to my struggles, as I grew tremendously from them. The first and most important way in which I&rsquo;ve grown is in my response to confusion. An overarching lesson to be learned at DBC (and perhaps in life) is to be <em>fearless in the face of confusion</em>, an idea Sherif introduced to us. Although I still have a long way to go, I am beginning to feel less overwhelmed and panicked when presented with a difficult problem or concept.</p>

<p>I have also grown to be more at peace with failure. I&rsquo;ve realized that any failure is temporary, and can be rectified at any later point. This was the case with my momentary Sudoku failure, as well as other points at which I felt like I just couldn&rsquo;t do it. Every time, all it took was good night&rsquo;s sleep to approach the problem with a fresh perspective and solve what seemed insurmountable the day before.</p>

<p>Lastly, I approach problems much more methodically. I had the serendipitous privilege of being a team lead on a small one-day project. Whereas before I would have been too scared to delegate tasks and trust the process, this time we pseudocoded as a group until everyone was clear about their input and output. We all worked separately, and all it took was 5 minutes of &ldquo;gluing&rdquo; to put the parts of the project together. I was so pleased with the fact that, despite not seeing exactly what my team was working on, their components fit together quite seamlessly. It was a great way of finishing off Phase 1, in direct contrast to the much less successful group project I had a week earlier.</p>

<p>My favorite Phase 1 teacher, Derek, said that Phase 1 makes you a programmer, but Phase 2 makes you a web developer. I am excited to forge ahead into unfamiliar territory, carrying with me the arsenal I acquired during Phase 1.</p>

<h3><em>embrace the confusion!</em></h3>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the second week of Phase 0 at DBC, we were asked to create our own websites, including a blog site. After laboring for many hours over it, including tinkering endlessly with CSS padding, margins, background-colors, etc (even just <em>thinking</em> about it overwhelms me!), I ended up with something I was pretty proud of! So for the last few months I&rsquo;ve been thinking, <em>&ldquo;Why not show off my own HTML CSS skills by keeping my original blog and presenting that to prospective employers, rather than using a framework?&rdquo;</em> I am now coming to realize I should indeed use a framework, which is needless to say because you&rsquo;re reading an Octopress blog. But why? Well, sure my original blog wasn&rsquo;t bad, but it was severely limited and had some bugs. The design wasn&rsquo;t completely responsive, and it didn&rsquo;t have nearly as much functionality (Facebook, Twitter, GutHub integration, DISQUS comments, etc.). Also, every time I wanted to write a post I would have to copy it in to the blog.html page and deal with annoying tags &ndash; not to mention the headache of including snippets of code. Bottom line: it was a hassle, and I&rsquo;ve realized no hackers really do it like that. Octopress is known as the &ldquo;hacker blog&rdquo; platform, and although the process of writing posts is relatively automated, you still use Sublime to write the posts, edit YML files yourself, and push to GitHub - so it really is a perfect hacker platform. There&rsquo;s no nitty gritty stuff like dealing with HTML tags, but the platform still requires the blogger to know how to use git and make changes to files written in various programming languages.</p>

<h3>But what about the design? Isn&rsquo;t it too bland?</h3>

<p>Well, I probably would have thought that a few months ago, but not now. I used to think that the more technical, animated, interactive a site is, the better&hellip; and that a site&rsquo;s coolness was determined by how many cool JS and jQuery features are implemented. Not so! What&rsquo;s the function? Form should follow function, and if the function is to read content and navigate blog arhives, you don&rsquo;t need any of that fancy stuff. It&rsquo;s not appropriate. Octopress does exactly what it should do, and nothing more.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hmm, good question! I would say it depends somewhat on the context in which the question is being asked, as well as the subject matter. For this blog post, to keep things within a manageable scope, I&rsquo;ll focus on what makes a good programming-related question. There&rsquo;s quite a lot of material out there about what makes good questions, and I echo many of the qualities that others have heralded. This post is a synthesis of outside sources with some of my own original thoughts and examples. The three overarching qualities that make good questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Specificity</li>
<li>Clarity</li>
<li>Relevance</li>
</ol>


<p>My fellow cohortmates are generally quite good at asking specific, clear, and relevant questions, but every once in a while you&rsquo;ll come across a question that more or less follows this pattern:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Help! I can&rsquo;t get this to work&rdquo;</p>

<p>(insert overly large block of code here)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it working?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s obvious enough, but this is an example of a not-so-great question. Is it specific? No. Is it clear? Not at all. Is it relevant? Perhaps, but it&rsquo;s impossible to tell since it isn&rsquo;t specific or clear enough. You should evaluate a question&rsquo;s worthiness based on how easily you understand it, without having to run the code yourself. If anyone wanted to help out this distressed person, they would have to run the code to see what error the person is talking about, then troubleshoot it for the person. That&rsquo;s too much to ask of an answerer. Ideally, a good question is asked once the asker has already done a preliminary troubleshooting session, has isolated the problem somewhat, and asks a more specific question regarding the error message and the particular piece of code that causes the error, not the entire program. Odds are only a small fraction of the entire code file is causing the problem, so include only that code!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s quickly look at each of the three qualities I mention are key ingredients to good questions.</p>

<h3>Specificity</h3>

<p>Is your question about a particular issue you are having with your code? Go into detail about the issue. Don&rsquo;t do what the distressed person did above and just plop the entire thing on someone else. Take time to investigate what the problem is, and explain it as specifically as you can. If you have a limited amount of characters to work with, such as in the title of a question, make sure you make it as specific as possible so potential answerers know what they&rsquo;re dealing with before they click your question. Here&rsquo;s an example of two questions, one is good and one is bad. It should be very obvious:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How does the math module work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you endow a class with the Math module in Ruby?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>So which one is bad? The first one, of course. It&rsquo;s not specific enough. How does it <em>&ldquo;work&rdquo;</em>? I&rsquo;m not even sure what that means, or how to answer it. It&rsquo;s far too general. And what language are you talking about? Multiple languages might have the same math module, so you better be clear about which one you&rsquo;re talking about! If your question leads answerers to ask you questions in return (like that first one), it&rsquo;s probably not good question. Now, the second one: it&rsquo;s much better. It asks about how you perform a particular action in a particular language. Anyone who stumbles upon this question in forums knows exactly how to answer it, because it is clear and specific.</p>

<h3>Clarity</h3>

<p>Make sure there are no ambiguities in your question. There should be one way of interpreting it, and it should be clear, understandable, and not too complex. Here are two more examples:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Calculating Averages in Ruby Name Error&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have this array: [1, 2, 3, 4] and a hash {1: &#8220;one&rdquo;, 2: &ldquo;two&rdquo;, 3: &ldquo;three&rdquo;, 4: &ldquo;four&rdquo;}. If I want to replace the array numbers with the hash variable, how would I do that?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Which one is bad? Both of them! The first one is incomprehensible and ambiguous. It suffers from being extremely unclear and extremely unspecific. The last one, while it is specific, is still ambiguous and almost too specific to be clear. The person could have asked: &ldquo;How do you replace the elements of an array with the values of a hash in Ruby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, this last question is much more digestible. It is clear, unambiguous, and specific without being overwhelming with unnecessary details.</p>

<h3>Relevance</h3>

<p>This last category is a bit trickier. Basically, an asker should ask a question that adds value to his or her understanding of a concept, and they should know their audience - who they are asking. In most cases, such as on Stack Overflow, this is a wold-wide network of brilliant programmers. Don&rsquo;t waste their time asking irrelevant or overly basic questions.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When was Ruby invented?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the difference between an integer and a float?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are seeking a fact, Google it. Why ask a team of programmers a meta-fact about Ruby that warrants, literally, a one-word response? It&rsquo;s not worth their time, and it&rsquo;s certainly not an efficient use of your time, either! And how about the second example? It&rsquo;s not quite as bad, but again, this is a very basic question that you are better off discovering for yourself through your own research. Read about what an integer is, what a float is, and try working with them. If you come across a specific problem regarding the use of integers and floats in a program, <em>that&rsquo;s</em> the time to ask a question.</p>

<p>I know I may have veered a bit into what makes a good question on the Internet, but the basic tenets still apply to questions asked in the physical world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>JavaScript event listeners are kind of like the nervous system of a website. Without them, the website does not have the ability to sense, or &ldquo;listen to&rdquo;, actions the user can take (such as clicking, pressing keys, loading the page, etc). I first learned event listeners through programming my first JS project, the <a href="http://blog.liorrmorrison.com/dbc/airport">airporter game</a>. Event listeners allow you to change or manipulate HTML/CSS elements when a certain element &ldquo;hears&rdquo; an event. To illustrate this idea, let&rsquo;s take an example from my airport game. It would help you understand this explanation if you played a quick round of the game first! In the game, I have two event listeners, one that targets the entire window and one that targets an HTML element:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">airbus</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;click&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">clearWay</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;keydown&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">move</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s analyze the syntax of these event listeners. The functionality of the <code>addEventListener</code> function is obvious enough, but what&rsquo;s going on with the rest of it? You call the <code>addEventListener</code> function on an HTML/DOM element. In the first example, it is being called on <code>airbus</code>, which is an a div in the HTML with the id &ldquo;airbus&rdquo;. If you have played the game, the airbus is the &ldquo;little scoundrel&rdquo; airplane that gets in the way of your progress! Now, what&rsquo;s going on in the parenthesis? The <code>addEventListener</code> function takes two parameters: an event, and a function to run when that event occurs (there is an optional boolean third parameter, but it is pretty technical so I won&rsquo;t discuss it here). In the first example, the event is &lsquo;click&rsquo;, and the function is clearWay. So when the airbus element is clicked, the clearWay function will be run. I defined the clearWay function such that it changes the element&rsquo;s top style to 200px from where it originally was lower down on the runway. How does this manifest? Well, if you click the airbus on the page, it moves up away from the runway! As for the second example, why do we target the window if we really mean to move the other airplane? Well, the &lsquo;keydown&rsquo; event can&rsquo;t really target a particular HTML DOM element. The only part of a web page that can &ldquo;hear&rdquo; it is the window itself! That allows you to use the arrow keys to control the airplane without having to click, scroll over, or do anything to the airplane itself. As you can see, the second event listener executes the &ldquo;move&rdquo; function upon the &lsquo;keydown&rsquo; event (which, in the move function, I limit to just the arrow keys). The move function changes the boeing element&rsquo;s CSS positioning. Event listeners are the link between JavaScript and HTML/CSS elements. Without them, no script would be able communicate with and manipulate the web page!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some reflections as I finish up my penultimate week of Phase 0. This is going to be more of a Joycean, stream-of-consciousness thing rather than something with even a modicum of structure, just to warn whoever might be reading this. First of all, oh man - I can&rsquo;t believe how quickly these weeks have been passing. I think there must be a magic recipe to have time fly: just enough work and mental stimulation to keep you busy and thinking on your feet, but not enough to stress you out or overwhelm you. That is exactly what Phase 0 has been. I was challenged just enough so that I didn&rsquo;t feel bored, but not too much as to resemble the stereotyped, never-ending 9-5 work week that Americans hate but do anyway. I realize the intensive phases will not be as leisurely and balanced as Phase 0 has been, but honestly I&rsquo;m ready for a challenge. Staying at home 5 days a week, while perfectly pleasant, is not the most stimulating environment. Let&rsquo;s just say 9 weeks of Phase 0 is a good amount. Anything greater and I&rsquo;d start to get a little stir crazy.</p>

<p>Now, as for material: it&rsquo;s pretty neat to see my progress, even though it&rsquo;s not that obvious. My mind is just far more used to thinking like a programmer, and my familiarity with Ruby especially makes it so that I have many tools in my arsenal to tackle almost any logic challenge. JavaScript has been a bit of a struggle, though I am determined to overcome my aversion to it, since it seems significantly more important in the overall software development world than Ruby (client-side &amp;&amp; server-side, whereas Ruby is just server-side). This is especially true with maps and mapping software, as much of the functionality is done on the client-side&hellip; and because I am obsessed with maps, I will need to become obsessed with JS! Hmm, what else? I think after doing a fair amount of both front-end and back-end, I can say that I prefer to technical challenge of back-end stuff, though I like that, in the snap of a finger, you can see front-end changes. An ideal place for me, perhaps, would be the back-end of the front-end, if such a place exists. I want to work on things that have visual components, but I don&rsquo;t want to just be tinkering around with changing font-sizes, padding, and margin.</p>

<p>So, here I am, 9 days away from Phase 1. I look forward to delving into Ruby for the first few weeks. I am keeping in mind the cultural components of DBC and remembering that this is a kitchen and we are all cooks. I can&rsquo;t expect anything to be served to me; I expect to create and co-create and have full autonomy over what I do. I want to check in with myself every once in a while to make sure I am sticking to my goals. As I am 20 years old and without a college degree, I have so many doubts and insecurities that I will continue to try to whisk away to the best of my ability. Who would hire me? But I need to keep the faith that the status quo is changing and that, at least in the tech world, a B.A. doesn&rsquo;t mean nearly as much as an impressive technical interview or even a single cool code project. I think being in the DBC environment will really help me gain confidence, insha&#8217;Allah.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Delving into the completely different world of JavaScript after having spent over a month getting cozy with Ruby was a bit of a rude awakening. Suddenly my comfort and fluency was out the window &ndash; I felt like I was starting from scratch! What had become second nature in Ruby I now had to research in JavaScript - nooooo! But after spending some hours reading and studying, I feel like I&rsquo;m finally getting my bearings.</p>

<p>JavaScript and Ruby are both powerful object-oriented languages, but they are designed for two completely different purposes. Ruby is a server-side back-end language whose processes don&rsquo;t really have a visual component. Ruby processes and manipulates data and makes calls to the server&rsquo;s database. JavaScript, on the other hand, although it can be used as a server-side language (Google node.js!), is primarily a client-side language that runs in the web browser and is responsible for making websites dynamic and interactive. That&rsquo;s why, despite being a very capable scripting language, JavaScript is typically considered to be a front-end language.</p>

<p>There are many other differences between these two languages as well, the most obvious of which is syntax. Ruby&rsquo;s defining characteristic is the use of the keyword end. You must use end to signal the end of a method definition, class definition, loop, or block. JavaScript, on the other hand, is distinguished by the presence of curly braces and semicolons. Let&rsquo;s compare the following two methods (one written in Ruby, the other in JavaScript) that do the same thing; see if you can figure out which is which!</p>

<p>Well? It&rsquo;s pretty obvious, isn&rsquo;t it? You can definitely see the similarities and figure out that each function is doing the same thing, but there are several key differences. For one, the JavaScript loop is completely different-looking from Ruby&rsquo;s <code>#each</code> method. JavaScript also requires (in most cases, though not all) a semicolon at the end of each executable statement, whereas Ruby does not. Ruby determines the extent of methods, loops, and blocks with the end keyword, while JavaScript relies on the meat of a method or loop to be wrapped in curly braces. JavaScript also requires you to use the keyword <code>var</code> at the beginning of each variable assignment.</p>

<p>If I had to pick a favorite, I&rsquo;d choose Ruby hands-down&hellip; I&rsquo;m biased, of course, by my lack of experience as a developer and my familiarity with Ruby. Both languages are incredibly powerful and integral the world of software development, and I&rsquo;m sure my appreciation for JavaScript will increase as I continue to work with it and see its true potential.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Broadly, stereotype threat is a situation in which a person feels themselves to be living out negative stereotypes associated with their social group. It is a vicious cycle, because as the person continues to worry about their stereotype-affirming habits or behavior, they sabotage their chances of defeating and overcoming the stereotype threat, since the concept is rooted in a person&rsquo;s perception, not in reality. As a white male who grew up middle class and attended private school all my life, I am what many people would consider the privileged of the privileged, so how on earth could I relate to stereotype threat? Honestly, I haven&rsquo;t experienced it until recently, when I joined a social group I never thought I&rsquo;d be a part of: college dropouts. Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Despite my full devotion to academic success during high school, I find myself now, a couple years after graduation, not enrolled in college. Since leaving college a year ago, I&rsquo;ve been able to keep a pretty high morale, as I have plans, ambitions, and drive; but every once in a while, it dawns on me that&hellip; I am a college dropout. I think about my friends who are still in college, studying abroad, pursuing their degrees, and here I am, not doing that. If I let myself think about this too much, I become sad, depressed, discouraged, unmotivated. It spirals out of control. Even though I am doing something far more rewarding - forging my own path, delving into computer programming - I get sad and my morale plummets. Luckily I don&rsquo;t let these periods last too long, so I&rsquo;m not actually concerned I will start to waste my life away, but it&rsquo;s still a problem I&rsquo;m dealing with.</p>

<p>As for how to combat this phenomenon, there is no easy answer. I as an individual, while not completely powerless, can only do so much to lift peoples&#8217; morales. It really is as simple as realizing that the perceived threat is not a real one - it is entirely within your power to challenge the stereotype, just say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and life live with purpose and drive. Having said that, I realize that &rsquo;s easier said than done. It really comes down to how much confidence you have in yourself. To mitigate the effects of stereotype threat, I will try to lift people up - be complimentary, encouraging, patient. At the very least, this will help people get confidence to continue down their journeys and be less bogged down by stereotypes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ruby provides programmers with a range of variable types, all defined by their scope &ndash; where they can be accessed. The variables, in order of increasing scope, are local variables, instance variables, class variables, constants, and global variables. Let&rsquo;s dive in to see the accessibility of each of the variable types.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s start with local variables. As their name suggests, local variables have a local scope, limited to the method or block in which they are defined. They must start with a lower-case letter or underscore. Consider the following example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">local_method</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">local_variable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;m a local variable&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">times</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">local_variable</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">local_method</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;m a local variable&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;m a local variable&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;m a local variable&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;m a local variable&quot;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">local_variable</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="c1"># NameError: undefined local variable or method `local_variable&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this example, the variable <code>local_variable</code> is defined within the method. It can be accessed by the method itself, as we see it successfully executes the code block with the variable; but if we try to access it from outside the method, we get an error message that the variable is undefined. It&rsquo;s undefined because, as a local variable, its scope is limited to within the method itself. What if we were to define a local variable within block within a method?</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># NameError: undefined local variable or method `very_local_variable&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What just happened? In this example, <code>very_local_variable</code> is defined within a block that is within a method. When called, the method executed the block successfully, but then when <code>very_local_variable</code> was called outside of the block in which it was defined, ruby told us it was undefined! This example shows you just how limited in scope local variables are: if defined within a block within a method, the method won&rsquo;t even have access to it! Now let&rsquo;s move on to instance variables.</p>

<p>Instance variables are variables limited to one particular instance of a class. They must begin with a single &ldquo;@&rdquo; character. To illustrate the scope of instance variables, consider the following example:</p>

<p>When we instantiate the Person class, we must give that instance a name and hair color. In the initialize method, these two parameters are turned into instance variables which can then be accessed by other methods in the class, but only on that single instance. For example, if we call <code>tom.first_name</code>, you can see that the program returns the input first name; same with the hair color. If we call these two methods on <code>muhammad</code> we see that we get different results. That is precisely because <code>@first_name</code> and <code>@hair_color</code> are instance variables, only to be used on a single instance of the class. In this case, tom and <code>muhammad</code> are two separate instances of the class Person. But Tom and Muhammad are both people, after all! What if we want them to share some characteristics? For that, we&rsquo;ll need class variables.</p>

<p>Class variables are those available to every instance of that class. What is one trait that all people have in common? Consider a similar example:</p>

<p>As you can see, the <code>@@species</code> variable is not only available to Tom, but also to Muhammad, and every other instance of <code>Person</code>!</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s move on to constants and global variables. These two are similar in scope, but let&rsquo;s start with constants. Constants must be all-caps and, traditionally, are not to be changed. Technically, Ruby does allow the user to change them, but that runs counter to their whole point of being constant, unchanging variables. Like local variables, their scope is slightly fluid. If they are defined within a class, they are available anywhere in the context of that class. If they are defined outside a class, they have global scope, which means they are accessible from anywhere. To demonstrate these concepts, let&rsquo;s return again to our first example:</p>

<p>What if we turned <code>local_variable</code> into a CONSTANT? We aren&rsquo;t allowed to define CONSTANTS within methods, because technically every time we run the method we&rsquo;d be re-assigning the constant (even though to the same string value, it would still have a different object ID every time, which isn&rsquo;t allowed), so let&rsquo;s define it outside the method.</p>

<p>Look! the method has access to the constant even though it&rsquo;s defined outside of the method! The same goes for global variables, except they actually can be defined within methods:</p>

<p>In this example, <code>$global_variable</code> is accessible in the block in which it&rsquo;s defined, in the method itself (this is where a local variable would start giving us problems), and outside the block and method entirely!</p>
