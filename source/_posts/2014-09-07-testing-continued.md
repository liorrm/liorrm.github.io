A few more notes to add about testing.
The entire testing process is comprised of different types of testing, including unit testing, feature testing, and integration testing.

-Unit Testing

Unit testing is the process of testing small units of code before implementing and integrating them into functionalities of a software. For example, if you were building a website that took credit card payments and wanted to check whether or not the user entered in a valid card number, you would want to make sure that the small piece of code that checks for a valid card number actually works before integrating it into the software.

-Integration Testing

The next step after unit testing is integration testing, which tests how those smaller units of code work in tandem. Perhaps several units of code come together to provide a working functionality element of a software, but not the entire working product.

-Feature testing

Feature testing is one of the last steps of the testing process in which the code comes together to form a working, functional product that a user can interface with. Feature testing may or may not be testing of the entire software, but it at the very least tests a major working component. Feature testing is usually less technical and actually involves using the software to ensure it works properly.
