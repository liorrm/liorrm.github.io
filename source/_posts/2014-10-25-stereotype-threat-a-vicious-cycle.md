Broadly, stereotype threat is a situation in which a person feels themselves to be living out negative stereotypes associated with their social group. It is a vicious cycle, because as the person continues to worry about their stereotype-affirming habits or behavior, they sabotage their chances of defeating and overcoming the stereotype threat, since the concept is rooted in a person's perception, not in reality. As a white male who grew up middle class and attended private school all my life, I am what many people would consider the privileged of the privileged, so how on earth could I relate to stereotype threat? Honestly, I haven't experienced it until recently, when I joined a social group I never thought I'd be a part of: college dropouts. Yes, that's right. Despite my full devotion to academic success during high school, I find myself now, a couple years after graduation, not enrolled in college. Since leaving college a year ago, I've been able to keep a pretty high morale, as I have plans, ambitions, and drive; but every once in a while, it dawns on me that... I am a college dropout. I think about my friends who are still in college, studying abroad, pursuing their degrees, and here I am, not doing that. If I let myself think about this too much, I become sad, depressed, discouraged, unmotivated. It spirals out of control. Even though I am doing something far more rewarding - forging my own path, delving into computer programming - I get sad and my morale plummets. Luckily I don't let these periods last too long, so I'm not actually concerned I will start to waste my life away, but it's still a problem I'm dealing with.

As for how to combat this phenomenon, there is no easy answer. I as an individual, while not completely powerless, can only do so much to lift peoples' morales. It really is as simple as realizing that the perceived threat is not a real one - it is entirely within your power to challenge the stereotype, just say "no", and life live with purpose and drive. Having said that, I realize that 's easier said than done. It really comes down to how much confidence you have in yourself. To mitigate the effects of stereotype threat, I will try to lift people up - be complimentary, encouraging, patient. At the very least, this will help people get confidence to continue down their journeys and be less bogged down by stereotypes.
