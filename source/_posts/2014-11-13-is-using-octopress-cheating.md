During the second week of Phase 0 at DBC, we were asked to create our own websites, including a blog site. After laboring for many hours over it, including tinkering endlessly with CSS padding, margins, background-colors, etc (even just *thinking* about it overwhelms me!), I ended up with something I was pretty proud of! So for the last few months I've been thinking, *"Why not show off my own HTML CSS skills by keeping my original blog and presenting that to prospective employers, rather than using a framework?"* I am now coming to realize I should indeed use a framework, which is needless to say because you're reading an Octopress blog. But why? Well, sure my original blog wasn't bad, but it was severely limited and had some bugs. The design wasn't completely responsive, and it didn't have nearly as much functionality (Facebook, Twitter, GutHub integration, DISQUS comments, etc.). Also, every time I wanted to write a post I would have to copy it in to the blog.html page and deal with annoying tags -- not to mention the headache of including snippets of code. Bottom line: it was a hassle, and I've realized no hackers really do it like that. Octopress is known as the "hacker blog" platform, and although the process of writing posts is relatively automated, you still use Sublime to write the posts, edit YML files yourself, and push to GitHub - so it really is a perfect hacker platform. There's no nitty gritty stuff like dealing with HTML tags, but the platform still requires the blogger to know how to use git and make changes to files written in various programming languages.

### But what about the design? Isn't it too bland?

Well, I probably would have thought that a few months ago, but not now. I used to think that the more technical, animated, interactive a site is, the better... and that a site's coolness was determined by how many cool JS and jQuery features are implemented. Not so! What's the function? Form should follow function, and if the function is to read content and navigate blog arhives, you don't need any of that fancy stuff. It's not appropriate. Octopress does exactly what it should do, and nothing more.
