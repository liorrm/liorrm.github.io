It has been a little while since I've posted on here, but of course that's to be expected, since the intensive, on-site portion of DBC started a couple days after my last post. I can't even begin to describe how much I have learned, struggled, and grown through the first phase. Although learning, struggling, and growing could be seen as three sides of some mutant three-sided coin (I guess that would be like a cylinder?), which indeed they are, I'll reflect briefly upon the three of them separately.


###Learning

I have learned a great deal of new material, but most importantly, I have learned new paradigms and have taken my already existing Ruby knowledge to a level I never knew existed. A few weeks ago ago I would have been proud of a 15-line method that checked whether or not a credit card number was valid. Gone are the days of creating these 'all-in-ones', what DBC calls *God Methods*. I have learned the concepts of single responsibility methods and classes, object-oriented design, and reducing dependencies---within classes, between classes, and even in methods by using the argument hash.

Another significant learning feat was moving in the direction of less primitive terminal apps by impleneting multiple-file apps, SQL databases, ActiveRecord, and the model-view-controller design paradigm (hinting towards the beast that is Ruby on Rails).

Beyond this, my vanilla Ruby skills have improved a great deal, as I feel leagues more confident navigating almost any programming problem. The difficult part is no longer "how do I do this in Ruby?", but rather, "how do I break this problem down into tangible steps?"


###Struggling

I have struggled in two major regards these past few weeks: one, in how to approach programming challenges with many components, such as with the Sudoku solver challenge during the first week of Phase 1; and two, in how to work on a project with people of varying personalities, from timid and quiet to dominant and loud. The idea of fleshing out the problem in pseudocode (or as one of my Phase 1 teachers calls it on the Friday of Sudoku, *Sud-*o*-code) was one I could grasp in the abstract, but when it came down to tackling the problem, I always felt myself gravitating towards just hacking away at the keyboard without giving the problem enough forethought. It was my first experience tackling a challenge of this magnitude, and for the first time I couldn't really get away with my Phase 0 forge-ahead-blindly approach. This refusal to take a step back led to much frustration and ultimately not being able to complete the challenge by the end of the day. Although I did complete it the next day, the big takeaway from that day-long struggle was to make sure you know what you're going to do before you do it. Never explore unfamiliar territory without a map---or at the very least, a compass!

One more struggle, which combines the two above: group work, especially with unclear expectations and ambiguous leadership. It's not easy, and it's very frustrating. The lack of clarity leads to not being able to delegate tasks, and instead everyone working on the same task, which is incredibly inefficient. As Sherif, one of my teachers, put it, it's like doing an "eight legged sock race", which is exactly how it felt during one exercise.


###Growing

My growing is very much tied to my struggles, as I grew tremendously from them. The first and most important way in which I've grown is in my response to confusion. An overarching lesson to be learned at DBC (and perhaps in life) is to be *fearless in the face of confusion*, an idea Sherif introduced to us. Although I still have a long way to go, I am beginning to feel less overwhelmed and panicked when presented with a difficult problem or concept.

I have also grown to be more at peace with failure. I've realized that any failure is temporary, and can be rectified at any later point. This was the case with my momentary Sudoku failure, as well as other points at which I felt like I just couldn't do it. Every time, all it took was good night's sleep to approach the problem with a fresh perspective and solve what seemed insurmountable the day before.

Lastly, I approach problems much more methodically. I had the serendipitous privilege of being a team lead on a small one-day project. Whereas before I would have been too scared to delegate tasks and trust the process, this time we pseudocoded as a group until everyone was clear about their input and output. We all worked separately, and all it took was 5 minutes of "gluing" to put the parts of the project together. I was so pleased with the fact that, despite not seeing exactly what my team was working on, their components fit together quite seamlessly. It was a great way of finishing off Phase 1, in direct contrast to the much less successful group project I had a week earlier.

My favorite Phase 1 teacher, Derek, said that Phase 1 makes you a programmer, Phase 2 makes you a web developer. I am excited to forge ahead into unfamiliar territory, carrying with me the arsenal I acquired during Phase 1---*embrace the confusion!*
