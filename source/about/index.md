I'm a programming n00b who's delving into web dev technologies such as Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, Sinatra, APIs, and a whole host of other stuff that I'll add here as soon as I start learning them. I'm a student at Dev Bootcamp and want to work in the in a geospatial-related tech company that deals with maps and spacial analysis. I'm into cars, commercial aviation, languages, and I'm a big geography buff. Most of what you see on here will probably be tech-related, but every once in a while I might write stuff about my other interests.
